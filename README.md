# StereoCamera
Making a stereo camera using feed from 2 cameras and tracing Red Object.
Image Processing is used in OpenCV (for java) for detecting the red object. The co-ordinates of the red object are obtained by
using trignometrical functions. 
Hence a stereo camera is built using two webcams deparated by 30cm (in this case).
